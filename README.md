# AsyncApiCall
 
## What i am trying to do 
Fething data from third party api is very
 easy in languages like **python and javascript** 
 but in java the existing library like **retrofit 
 and OkHttp** are very complex and has a long 
 learning curve and getting used to it so what 
 i am trying to build is a java library that will
 fetch data from any end point, and will be as 
 easy as possible.  
  
### I urge you to use intelij ide as this is a gradle project
