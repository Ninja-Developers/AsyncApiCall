# AsyncApiCall
 
## What i am trying to do 
Fething data from third party api is very easy in languages like python and javascript but in java the existing library like retrofit and OkHttp are very complex and has a long learning curve and getting used to it so what i am trying to build is a java library that will fetch data from any end point, and will be as easy as possible.
